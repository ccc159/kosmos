# kosmos
Paul Klee Museum Hackathon : 
Kosmos Klee aims to foster conversation and collectively give art a voice. 
Using message boards bound to individual art pieces, visitors and curator can explore, express and validate their impressions with others. 
These impressions are analyzed and cross-referenced to create meaning and relations between pieces and users.
